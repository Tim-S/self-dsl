The model, in turn, is a concrete programm\nwith many variable definitions.\n\n\nA meta model may, thus, be sketched as follows:\n\n\n\n\nA program (domain model) may look as follows:\n\n\n\n\nOverview: aspects of meta modeling\n\n\nA summary of different aspects to be specified by the meta model is given\nas follows. This list is inspired by the grammar based toolset\n\nXtext\n\nand \nTextX\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhich \ndomain objects\n exist (\nglossary\n)?\n\n\nHow are objects identified (\nnamed\n)?\n\n\nWhich \nattributes\n do objects have?\n\n\nWhat objects are \ncomposed\n of other objects?\n\n\nWhat objects \naggregates\n other objects?\n\n\nHow do objects \nreference\n each other (including context effects/\nscoping\n)?\n\n\nHow can I \nspecialize\n objects?\n\n\nHow can I \nconnect\n objects?\n\n\nModularization\n: How can an object reference another object from another model\n    (form the same meta model or a different one)?\n\n\nInteroperability\n: How can an object reference something from outside\n    the toolset scope (inter-tool operability)?\n\n\nValidation\n: How can custom rules be checked automatically?\n\n\n\n\nDomain objects: identification and attributes\n\n\nDomain objects represent a central part of a \nglossary\n. Thus,\ndefining such objects is a central part of any software specification\nand must be using through its design.\n\n\nDomain objects\n can represent things, like \"Customers\", \"Computers\",\n\"State machines\". In our context they can also represent activities\nand relationships,  like \"owns\" (a customers owns a computer) or\n\"runs\" (a computer runs a state machine).\nDomain objects may have \nattributes\n, some of them optional. These attributes\nmay have a \nscalar\n value or represent a \nlist\n of entries. The value of the\nattributes can be specified to represent some \nbasic type\n (like a string or a\nnumber) or \nother domain\n objects.\n\n\nImportantly, some domain objects need to be identified by a name (like a\n\"Customer\"), while other objects do not (like the \"Birthday\" in our\nexample below).\n\n\n\n\nNote: Domain objects in the meta model represent a blueprint or a class of a\nconcrete instances of such objects in a concrete model.\n\n\nComposing objects\n\n\nDomain objects may be composed of other domain objects. Such a relationship\ncan be described by an attribute with a domain object type (like in the last\nsection). An alternative representation is illustrated as follows, but\ndescribes exactly the same thing:\n\n\n\n\nNote: in this example, a Customer is composed of a Birthday object.\nThe Birthday object cannot exist without the Customer. This relationship\nis called \ncomposition\n and has clear \nownership\n semantics.\n\n\nReferences and Aggregation\n\n\nSome domain objects need to reference identifiable objects without\nhaving their ownership. This happens, e.g.,\nwhen describing domain object relationships within the model (e.g. a\nCustomer owns a Computer; relationship \"own\"). Such relationships themselves\ncan own additional attributes (e.g. \"owns since date\").\n\n\n\n\nNote: non-owning knowlegde of other objects is called \naggregation\n. Simple\nrelationships can be presented by a simple link (without attributes and without\nown rule/class definition).\n\n\nScoping\n\n\nScoping is relevant to \ndescribe what objects are identifiable\n when \nreferencing\nother objects\n. This is especially of importance, when some default visibility\nis not valid (most default scoping mechanisms allow all identifiable objects to be\nreferenced globally).\n\n\nAssume the following meta model snippet, where a \"Scenario\" is composed of\n\"Configurations\" and a \"Testcase\" references \"Scenarios\" and \"Configurations\":\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, we want that \nonly \"Configurations\" of the \"Scenario\"\nreferenced by a \"Testcase\" are visible to the \"Testcase\"\n. This\nrestriction is context specific (to the context of the \"Testcase\" described\nby the referenced \"Scenario\"). Scoping mechanisms allow to define this scope.\n\n\nSpecialization (base classes/base rules)\n\n\nSometimes it happens that some domain object is too generic and needs to\nbe specialized. This may happen when the language evolves.\nDuring the initial design commonalities are identified which lead to\nthe same pattern (base class and specialization).\n\n\n\n\nModularization\n\n\nThis happens when a model is splitted  in multiple submodels\n(e.g., different files).\n\n\n\n\nCombining meta models\n\n\nTo foster modularization, meta models can be splitted and still allow to\nreference domain objects of one meta model from the other meta model. In our last example\nwe could define a meta model for \"Testcases\" and one meta model for\n\"Scenarios\". This feature is more demanding to the underlying technology but\nallows a \nmodularization of the meta model and, thus, the glossary\n.\n\n\nInteroperability with other toolsets or software components\n\n\nIn larger projects external databases or models may need to be referenced.\nSuch external sources of information may be, e.g., am existing database of\nrequirements, some JSON or XML file or similar things. Interoperability with\nthese sources of information allow to link the model to that source.\n\n\n\n\nValidation\n\n\nThe validation of a model consists of \nadditional checks on top of structural\nconsistency\n defined by the grammar and scoping.\n\n\n\n\nError in the structure\n    result in classical syntax errors (\"\nexpected\n 'XY' instead of 'AB'\").\n\n\nScoping, in turn, defines the possible references in some context and,\n    thus, yields errors of the catergory \"referenced element 'XY' \nnot found\n.\".\n\n\nThe \nvalidation\n described in this section is about additional\n    \nlogical checks\n, once the model is correctly parsed and all\n    references resolved. This additional checks typically have a\n    \nstrong relation to the domain\n.\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n Assume a model where \"testcases\" reference \"configurations of\nscenarios\" which have certain \"aspects\". On the other hand a \"testcase\" may\nneed certain aspects. If any of the \"Aspects\" required by a \"testcase\" is not\navailabe in the referenced \"configuration\", a logical error is reported\n(validation error).\n\n\nRationale\n for choosing a validation over a scoping solution in this case:\nWhen modeling a situation where a \"configuration\" is chosen by a \"testcase\"\nwithout providing the correct \"aspects\", one would not like to get a\n\"configuration ot found\", which would result if only \"configurations\" with matching\n\"aspects\" are defined in the \nscope\n of a \"testcase\". In contrast, the\n\nvalidation\n will allow all \"configurations\" of the selected \"scenario\" of\na \"testcase\" to be visible, but some of them will produce a\n\nmeaningful domain error\n, such as\n\"configuration 'config_B' does not provide the aspect 'aspect_X' required\nby testcase 'test_T1'\".\n\n\nThe structure defined in the meta model is shown as follows:\n\n\n\n\nA model with validation error (\n\"configuration 'config_B' does not provide the aspect 'aspect_X' required\nby testcase 'test_T1'\"\n) is shown as follows:\n\n\nscenario scenario_001 {\n    configuration config_A has {aspect_X}\n    configuration config_B has {aspect_Y}\n}\ntestcase test_T1 {\n    use scenario_001 with config_B\n    and needs {aspect_X}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA model without validation error is shown as follows:\n\n\nscenario scenario_001 {\n    configuration config_A has {aspect_X}\n    configuration config_B has {aspect_Y, aspect_X}\n}\ntestcase test_T1 {\n    use scenario_001 with config_B\n    and needs {aspect_X}\n}",
