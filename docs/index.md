# Welcome to self-dsl

This is a tutorial site for the creation of domain specific languages.

 * [Motivation](motivation.md):
    Why using a DSL? What is the value of it? What is MDSD?

 * [Basics of meta modeling](basics.md)
    What is meta modeled?

 * Tutorial-like topics for Xtext and TextX (see sidebar).

 * [References](references.md)

## Employed software to generate this documentation

 * We use [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) to build these
pages (using the [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/)
theme).
 * We employ [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) to produce UML graphics
(together with a [plugin](https://github.com/mikitex70/plantuml-markdown)
working together with  [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/)).
