# TextX Project Setup

We give a guide to create a simple
command line tool to load and validate a
model and to generate some artifact.

In this example, we propose different models for
the __meta model structure__ (grammar), the __scoping__,
and the __ artifact generation__. Moreover, a 
__main__ and a __setup__ script are added to control
the software.
