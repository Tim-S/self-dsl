# TextX Project Setup

We give a guide to create a simple
command line tool to load and validate a
model and to generate some artifact.

In this example, we propose different models for
the __meta model structure__ (grammar), the __scoping__,
and the __ artifact generation__. Moreover, a 
__main__ and a __setup__ script are added to control
the software.

For this example we use Python 3. You need to install 

  * TextX (see [references](references.md)).
  * Arpeggio (see TextX in [references](references.md))
  * pytest

Just 

    :::shell
    pip3 install --upgrade textx arpeggio pytest
